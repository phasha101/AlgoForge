# AlgoForge

Sharpen your algorithm skills for coding challenges and interviews.

This repository is structured into **Easy**, **Intermediate**, and **Hard** modes, each containing folders for specific algorithm patterns.

Inside each folder, you’ll find: - Documentation explaining the algorithm - Example problems and solutions - Your own implementations - Contributions from others --- ## 📂
